#' Estimate years to pith using estimated distance to pith and innermost measured rings of series
#'
#' @description
#' Function to estimate the number of years to pith from estimated distance to pith, like that
#' determined in CooRecorder. The way you determine distance to pith is not important, as long as
#' the input data.frame is formatted in the same way (see `d2pith` argument below). The `"rings"`
#' method (the default) uses the arithmetic mean of n.rings to apply over the estimated
#' distance, rounded to the nearest whole year.
#'
#' @param rwl A rwl-type data.frame (e.g., read in by \code{\link[dplR]{read.rwl}}). Essentially a
#' data.frame with columns names as series IDs and years as row names.
#' @param d2pith A data.frame with at least 2 columns: 1) "series", representing the series names,
#' 2) "d2pith", representing the estimated distances to pith from innermost measured rings.
#' @param method Character vector of length 1 indicating which method to use, `"rings"`, or
#' `"dist"`. Default is "rings". See details below.
#' @param n.rings Numeric vector of length 1 representing the number of rings (years) you want to
#' use as an aggregate. For `method = "rings"` only.
#' @param diam.df A data.frame containing series names and the outside diameter measurements
#' associated with the tree those series belong to. For `method = "modeled"` only.
#' @param plot.hist Logical vector that turns on or off a histogram of the estimated years to pith.
#' This is an important guide to choosing the method or setting `n.rings` for method `"rings"`. See
#' details below.
#'
#' @details
#' There are a number of methods to estimate distance to and years to pith in core samples that
#' don't contain pith, from the old transparency method (citation?) to the Duncan (1989) method. I
#' assume that the user has some familiarity with these methods before using `yrs_to_pith()`.
#' CooRecorder (https://www.cybis.se/forfun/dendro/helpcoorecorder7/distanceToPith/index.htm)
#' has it's own intuitive method that is like a flexible version of the transparency method.
#' CooRecorder has the additional benefit that distance to pith estimates are essentially seamless
#' with ring measurements. Estimating years to pith in CooRecorder, however, is somewhat cumbersome.
#' This function is designed to save time by doing the calculations necessary for each series all
#' at once.
#'
#' Method "rings" is what most researchers will be familiar with - this is simply the mean of the
#' specified innermost `n.rings`. The default is 5 rings, but this may be too few for some samples
#' or datasets. Use the 'plot.hist' output to check this - if you have some extreme values (large
#' values of y2pith), you may need to increase `n.rings` or switch to method "dist". Extreme y2pith
#' values can arise from large d2pith values and/or if the innermost n.rings happen to be very
#' narrow. The take home message is that the value of `n.rings` is not allowing a robust enough
#' estimate of average ring width to apply over d2pith. Method "dist" attempts to circumvent the
#' estimation of a "Goldilocks" `n.rings` value by using instead the number of rings that add up to
#' d2pith instead (`n.rings` is variable). I.e., we use the mean ring width over the innermost
#' \emph{distance} equal to d2pith. Defaults to the mean of 5 innermost rings if d2pith yields less
#' than 5 rings.
#'
#'
#' @return A data.frame with 3 columns: 1) "series", 2) "d2pith", 3) "y2pith".

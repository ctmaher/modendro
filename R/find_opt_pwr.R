#' Find the optimal power for transforming a tree ring series to approximate homoscedasticity
#'
#' @description
#' Use a spread versus level method to estimate the optimal power of transformation for a tree
#' ring series
#'
#'
#' @details
#' This function estimates the optimal power of transformation via the local spread versus level
#' relationship of each series, where local spread is defined as the absolute value of the first
#' differences, S, (|rwt - rwt-1|) and the local level is the arithmetic mean of each pair of
#' adjacent values, M, (rwt + rwt-1)/2.
#' The spread versus level relationship is then modeled in a simple linear regression as
#' log10(S) ~ log10(M). The optimal power of transformation is then estimated as p = |1-slope| of
#' this regression model.
#' See \code{\link{cp_detrend}} and Cook & Peters (1997) for more details.
#'
#' Note that this is a very simple function that only implements the spread vs. level estimation
#' of an optimal power for making tree ring series Â± homoscedastic. Operationally in the `modendro`
#'  package, the final determination of how to transform series is performed in the
#'  \code{\link{pwr_t_rwl}} function, per Cook & Peters (1997).
#'
#' The `universal` and `ID.group.substr` arguments control how many series are included in the
#' spread vs. level estimation, allowing for the same transformation to be performed across all
#' tree ring series within each group (you determine the group). `universal` is a logical switch
#' while `ID.group.substr` is a 2-element numeric that passes to the `start` & `stop` args of
#' \code{\link[base]{substr}} which will act on the series IDs (i.e., the colnames in `rwl`). For
#' example, if the first 3 characters of your series IDs refers to the site where the series were
#' collected, you would specify `ID.group.substr = c(1, 3)`. Or, say the 4th element of the series
#' IDs refers to the species collected, you could specify `ID.group.substr = c(4, 4)` to estimate
#' optimal power by species. This assumes your series IDs contain this information in a systematic
#' way. If not, you could also just create separate rwls for each of the groups you are interested
#' in, set `universal = TRUE` and leave `ID.group.substr` unspecified.
#' The essential idea of a "universal power transformation" comes from a GitHub issues post in the
#' dplR repository by Stefan Klesse (2020). My approach here only scratches the surface of the idea
#' presented by Klesse, but is an incremental step in that direction.
#'
#'
#' @param rwl A rwl object (read in by dplR's  \code{\link[dplR]{read.rwl}}). Essentially a
#' data.frame with columns names as series IDs and years as rownames.
#' @param universal A logical vector indicating whether to compute a single "universal" optimal
#' power for all series within a group (if `TRUE` and arg `ID.group.substr` is unspecified,
#' will assume all series in the rwl). If `FALSE`, the function estimates a separate optimal power
#' for each individual series.
#' @param ID.group.substr A numeric vector of length 2 that determines a sub grouping for
#' calculating "universal" optimal power. Passes to \code{\link[base]{substr}} as the start
#' (1st number) and stop (2nd number) args to split the series IDs in your rwl into groups.
#'
#' @return A named numeric vector with the series IDs (colnames) and the estimated optimal power
#' of transformation for each series -or- a numeric vector of length 1.

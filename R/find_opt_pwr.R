#' Find the optimal power for transforming a tree ring series to approximate homoscedasticity
#'
#' @description
#' Use a spread versus level method to estimate the optimal power of transformation for a tree ring series
#'
#'
#' @details
#' This function estimates the optimal power of transformation via the local spread versus level relationship of each series,
#' where local spread is defined as the absolute value of the first
#' differences, S, (|rwt - rwt-1|) and the local level is the arithmetic mean of each pair of adjacent values, M, (rwt + rwt-1)/2.
#' The spread versus level relationship is then modeled in a simple linear regression as log10(S) ~ log10(M). The optimal power of transformation
#' is then estimated as p = |1-slope| of this regression model.
#' See ?cp_detrend and Cook and Peters (1997) for more details.
#'
#' Note that this is a very simple function that only implements the spread vs. level estimation
#' of an optimal power for making a tree ring series Â± homoscedastic. This function does not select which of these estimated
#' powers to use, that is performed in the  \code{\link{pwr_t_rwl}} function.
#'
#' @param rwl A rwl object (read in by dplR's  \code{\link[dplR]{read.rwl}}). Essentially a data.frame with columns names as series IDs and years as rownames.
#'
#' @return A named numeric vector with the series IDs (colnames) and the estimated optimal power of transformation

Description: A collection of functions to do a variety of tree-ring analyses: power transformation 
    & detrending, disturbance detection, flexible climate-growth correlations to identify the 
    strongest seasonal climate signals, & various utility functions for wrangling tree-ring data. 
    These functions represent both new and pre-existing methods that are not available in R elsewhere.

\title{Calculate the biweight scale}
\usage{
s_bi(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric vector}
}
\value{
a 2-column, 1-row data.frame with 2 estimates of s_bi: the main one from the Hoaglin et
al book & the Kafadar (1979) version that the authors also mention.
}
\description{
This function calculates the biweight scale (s_bi) - a robust variance estimator based on the
biweight robust mean.
From Hoaglin et al. 1983 p.417, eq. 3.
This is to support the cp_detrend function, following the methods of Cook & Peters 1997.
